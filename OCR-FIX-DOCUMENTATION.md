# ðŸ”§ OCR File Upload Fix

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the file upload issue where images with `application/octet-stream` MIME type (common with WhatsApp images) were being rejected.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Enhanced File Validation in OCR Router**
- Added support for `application/octet-stream` MIME type
- Added file extension validation as fallback
- Improved logging to show both MIME type and extension

### 2. **File Type Detection in OCR Service**
- Added magic number (file signature) validation
- Can detect actual file type regardless of MIME type
- Supports: JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF formats

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Development vs production error details
- Graceful fallback when preprocessing fails

## Supported File Types

| Format | Extensions | MIME Types | Magic Numbers |
|--------|------------|------------|---------------|
| JPEG   | .jpg, .jpeg | image/jpeg, image/jpg | FF D8 FF |
| PNG    | .png       | image/png | 89 50 4E 47 |
| BMP    | .bmp       | image/bmp | 42 4D |
| TIFF   | .tiff, .tif | image/tiff, image/tif | 49 49 2A 00 / 4D 4D 00 2A |

## How It Works Now

1. **MIME Type Check**: First checks if MIME type is in allowed list
2. **Extension Check**: If MIME type fails, checks file extension
3. **Magic Number Validation**: Validates actual file content using file signatures
4. **Preprocessing**: Uses Sharp to optimize image for OCR
5. **Fallback**: If preprocessing fails but file is valid, uses original buffer

## Test Cases Now Supported

âœ… **Normal uploads**: `image/jpeg` + `.jpg` extension  
âœ… **WhatsApp images**: `application/octet-stream` + `.jpg` extension  
âœ… **Corrupted MIME**: Any MIME type with valid image extension  
âœ… **Renamed files**: Files with wrong extension but correct magic numbers  

## Example Response for Fixed Issue

**Before (Error):**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Unsupported file format: application/octet-stream"
}
```

**After (Success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Document processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "documentType": "aadhaar",
    "extractedInfo": {
      "name": "SAMARTH SHARMA",
      "dob": "20-06-1986",
      "documentNumber": "238102571514"
    }
  }
}
```

## For Developers

The fix is backward compatible and handles edge cases:
- Files from different sources (WhatsApp, email, etc.)
- Files with incorrect MIME types
- Corrupted or missing file headers
- Various image formats and qualities

## Testing

To test the fix, upload any image file (especially from WhatsApp) with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ocr/process \
  -F "document=@IMG-20250913-WA0000.jpg" \
  -F "documentType=aadhaar"
```
